# **Redux MERN project Shop-Shop**

> ## **_Description_**

The Context API is quickly gaining traction as a worthy alternative or perhaps even successor to other libraries that manage global state in tandem with React, such as Flux or MobX. Nonetheless, the open-source JavaScript library Redux remains the industry standard for managing complex state in a large-scale React application, and it’s very likely that you’ll encounter it on the job.
